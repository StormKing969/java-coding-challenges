Developers at Doom have their applications deployed on n servers. Initially, the i-th server has an id server[i] and can
handle server[i] requests at a time.

For maintenance purposes, some servers are replaced periodically. On a j-th day, all the servers with id equal to
replaced[j] are replaced with servers with id newId[j] that can serve newId[j] requests. The total number of requests
served on a j-th day is the sum of the ids of the servers that the application is running on.

Given server, replaced, and newId, find the total number of requests served by the servers each day.

Note: The indices i and j are assumed to follow 1-based indexing.

Example:

Suppose n = 2, server = [20, 10], replaced = [10, 20], newId = [20, 1]

Table:

Day | Servers     | Replacement | New Servers | Total Requests
----|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------
1   | [20, 10]    | 10 → 20     | [20, 20]    | 20 + 20 = 40
2   | [20, 20]    | 20 → 1      | [1, 1]      | 1 + 1 = 2

Hence the answer is [40, 2].

Function Description

calculateDailyServerCapacity takes the following arguments:
    int server[n]: the initial server ids
    int replaced[n]: the ids of the servers to replace
    int newId[n]: the new ids of the replaced servers
Returns
    int[n]: the total number of requests that can be served each day
Constraints
    1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
    1 ≤ server[i], replaced[i], newId[i] ≤ 10^4
