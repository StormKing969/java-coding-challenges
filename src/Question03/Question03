Starfleet has multiple delivery centers all over the world. A city is given in the form of a grid where the delivery
centers are marked as 1 and all other places are marked as 0. Distance between two cells is defined as the maximum
absolute distance between x-coordinates and y-coordinates. For example, distance between (1,2) and (0,4) is
max(|1 - 0|, |2 - 4|) = 2. The inconvenience of the grid is defined as the maximum distance of any place marked 0 from
its nearest delivery center.

Starfleet is planning to open a new delivery center to reduce the inconvenience of the grid. Minimize the inconvenience
of the grid by converting at most one 0 (any place) to 1 (a delivery center) and report this minimum value.

Example:

Given n = 2 (rows), m = 4 (columns), grid = [[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1]]

Initial Grid:
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 1

Distances to nearest delivery centers:
3 2 1 0
3 2 1 0

Initial inconvenience = 3

It is optimal to convert (0,0) to a delivery center, resulting in:
1 0 0 1
0 0 0 1

New distances:
0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0

New inconvenience = 1
